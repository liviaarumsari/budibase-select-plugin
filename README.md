## Description

A custom Budibase component made for Dagangan front-end assesment project. Find out more about [Budibase](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase).

## Features
* Single-select and multi-select options
* Grouping options list
* Search options list

## Improvements
This component plugin still uses a hard-coded data for the options. For improvements, the options data need to be implemented from data provider or data source from budibase. Yet, because the lack of documentation in data source settings, author decided to not implement this.

## Requirements
* yarn
* Docker
* Budibase

## Instructions

To build this plugin run the following in your Budibase CLI:

```
budi plugins --build
```

You can also re-build everytime you make a change to the plugin with the command:

```
budi plugins --watch
```
